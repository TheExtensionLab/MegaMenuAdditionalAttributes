# MegaMenuAdditionalAttributes

This is a small module that uses TheExtensionLab_MegaMenu's ```'theextensionlab_megamenu/extra_attributes'``` config node and the new event ```menu_get_category_menu_data_after```, to add a new category attribute 'icon_image' to the Menu Object for use on the frontend.

***NOTE:*** Since most would do this as a theme customisation the frontend updates are not included but you can see more information in the blog post below.
